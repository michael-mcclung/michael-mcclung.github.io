            <p>I'm currently a student at <b><a class="aboutsection" href="https://www.ttu.edu">Texas Tech University</a></b> studying <b><a class="aboutsection" href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/">Computer Science</a></b>. I have worked at <b><a class="aboutsection" href="http://www.global-technology-integrators.com">Global Technology Inivators</a></b> and a two and a half month internship at <b><a class="aboutsection" href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/Pages/default.aspx">Northrop Grumman</a></b>.
            I have a passion for learning and expanding my skills. Texas Tech University facualty and staff has made that possible for me and motivated me to be the best that I can be. Wreck'em Tech!</p>

            <p>As I progress in school I want to be able to improve my web developement skiils along with perfecting my C++ and Java skills. I have a keen eye for design and believe I will be able to create amazing products. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient while providing engaging experiences. If I am not in front of a computer screen, I am probaly out in the nature or traveling. I also enjoy playing guitar, working out, and being around friends and family.</p>

            <p>Ever since I was a child I have always been into fixing things. One time my grandma could not figure out how to make the VHS tape player work. I believe I was about 10 years old. I walked over and with in 10 or less minutes I got the VHS to turn on and play the movie.</p>

            <p>When I was in school I was great at mathmatical problems and once I got to high school I was so far ahead of most my class mates because in middle school I went to a private school. I figured out that private schools had better professors and helped me to excel far beyond what I would have been able to acheive in a public school. I also had dyslexia and never let it get the best of me. I was able to get extra tutoring at St. John's Episcopal School and over came it sometime in high school.</p>

            <p>I love to travel, as I progress in my career I plan to travel the world. I have made another page that shows where I have been so far and I will add more along the way through out my life. I also love to play guitar... when I play I am in another world and feel free. I am starting to try to get into working out. I have always been told that as long as you have a healthy heart, your body will thank you and reward you with a long and prosperous life. Finally, I like to try to work on my programming skills and knowledge, in example I am recently updating this website through github and soon hope to mave my own website with my own custom name.</p>
